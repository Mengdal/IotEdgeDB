// Package throttle provides a small, allocation-free debounce primitive shared
// by the process-wide memory-release throttles (debug.FreeOSMemory, glibc
// malloc_trim). All three call sites previously duplicated the same eight lines
// of throttle bookkeeping; this centralizes them.
//
// The pattern, and every subtlety it encodes, comes from the #420 review:
//
//   - The window is anchored to the MONOTONIC clock (Go's time.Since over a
//     process-start instant), so an NTP step or a manual `date` change cannot
//     move the throttle window. Storing wall-clock nanoseconds would let a clock
//     jump either fire early or wedge the throttle.
//
//   - The stored "last fired" value is nanoseconds-since-process-start in an
//     atomic.Int64, and a stored value of 0 means "never fired". This sentinel
//     is load-bearing, not cosmetic: because time.Since(processStart) is a SMALL
//     duration early in the process's life (a few seconds), `now - 0` is less
//     than any practical interval, so without the sentinel the very FIRST call
//     would be throttled instead of firing. That exact bug shipped once during
//     #420 and cost ~25 MB of idle RSS before it was caught by the memory repro.
//     The wall-clock version accidentally avoided it (now - 0 was ~1.78e18, huge);
//     the monotonic version must handle it explicitly.
