// BuildHTTPRequest converts a Fiber context to a net/http Request for

// Lifecycle: every caller in this codebase (lineprotocol.go, msgpack.go,

// returned *http.Request synchronously within the Fiber handler — they
// pass it to router.RouteWrite/RouteQuery (which blocks on
// http.Client.Do, and internally already buffers the body via io.ReadAll
// for retry support, see internal/cluster/router.go forwardRequest) or
// to shardRouter.RouteWrite/RouteQuery, then read+close the response
// body inside CopyResponse, then return. fasthttp does not recycle the
// RequestCtx until after the handler returns (fasthttp server.go
// releaseCtx is post-handler), so wrapping c.Body() in bytes.NewReader
// directly is safe and avoids a copy that can be large at max payload
// (up to 1GB). Using c.Context() (returns *fasthttp.RequestCtx which
// implements context.Context) is also correct here — it propagates
// client-disconnect cancellation to the forwarded request, which
// c.UserContext() (returns context.Background()) does NOT.
//
// If a future refactor moves any of this work to a background goroutine
// or stream writer, those properties no longer hold and the caller
// must take a defensive copy + use a non-pooled context. Today's
// callers are all synchronous; revisit this if that changes.

	//   - hop-by-hop set (Connection, Keep-Alive, Proxy-Authenticate,
	//     Proxy-Authorization, Te, Trailers, Transfer-Encoding,
	//     Upgrade): these are connection-specific and MUST NOT be
	//     forwarded by intermediaries. CopyResponse already filters
	//     them on the response path via the same isHopByHop helper;
	//     the request path was missing this filter.
	//   - Content-Length: net/http sets req.ContentLength from the
	//     body (it knows the body is *bytes.Reader and gets its
	//     length), then writes Content-Length on the wire from
	//     ContentLength. Forwarding a Content-Length from the
	//     upstream header would duplicate the header or send a stale
	//     value mismatched with the actual body size.
	//
	// Add (not Set) preserves multi-value headers: fasthttp emits a
	// separate VisitAll callback per value, so Set would overwrite
	// earlier values and only the last would forward. Affects Via,
	// X-Forwarded-For, Accept (multiple content types), and similar.
	//
	// http.CanonicalHeaderKey before isHopByHop lookup: fasthttp
	// normalises header keys to canonical form by default, but a
	// future config change or fasthttp behavior shift could leave
	// non-canonical keys leaking through. Canonicalising defensively
	// also matches CopyResponse's behavior (Go's http.Header map keys
	// are always canonical-cased).
	// Direct map-write (rather than req.Header.Add) bypasses Add's
	// internal CanonicalHeaderKey re-canonicalisation — k is already
	// canonical from the line above, so re-canonicalising would be a
	// wasted string scan + allocation per header.
	//
	// Host filter: net/http's Request.Write skips the Host header in the
	// header map and writes Host from req.Host instead (req.go's
	// reqWriteExcludeHeader), so leaving it in req.Header doesn't leak
	// it onto the wire — but other code (middleware, logging, custom
	// transports) that reads req.Header.Get("Host") would see the

// falling through to a local path that is structurally guaranteed to fail.
//
// Splitting these two cases is also what makes the X-IEDB-Forwarded-By loop
// guard non-abusable. The header is client-settable (it survives at the
// HTTP boundary and is only overwritten on the *outbound* forward in
// internal/cluster/router.go), so an authenticated caller can set it on a
// direct request. Previously that collapsed into "do not forward" and the
// node then attempted local processing it could not complete — a
// client-triggered routing bypass / self-inflicted failure. Now a present
// header on a node that cannot route locally yields ForwardAlreadyForwarded,
// which the handler answers with a clear 508-style error. A genuine
// peer->peer loop terminates the same way. On a node that *can* serve
// locally the header is irrelevant and ignored entirely (the common case).
